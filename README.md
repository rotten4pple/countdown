countdown
=========

Solves the Countdown numbers game (hopefully).

You enter the 6 numbers and the target number (or get the computer to generate one or both), press "Go", and the PHP generates the solution (or finds the closest).

The rules are that you can use each number a maximum of once each, and you can only use the basic operators ( + - * / ) and brackets.

Example (with only 4 numbers):
Target: 44  
Numbers: 5, 10, 2, 3  
One solution:  5 * 10 - ( 2 * 3 )  

My goals are:

1. find a solution
1. find a solution as efficiently as possible
1. make the code as elegant as possible
1. make the front-end user friendly, maybe with AJAX and whatnot
